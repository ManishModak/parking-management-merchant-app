// The `logger_service.dart` is designed to improve the app's debugging process
// by collecting logs during runtime and sending them to the developer only
// when necessary (i.e., when a dispute is raised). This ensures that detailed
// logs are available for troubleshooting, helping the developer resolve
// issues efficiently.
