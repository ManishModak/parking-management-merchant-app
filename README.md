## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Development Issues

1. **iOS Permissions**: iOS build requires manual permission configuration in Info.plist
2. **Plaza ID Bug**: Plaza registration fails if Plaza ID starts with '0' (Backend issue)
3. **Camera Dependencies**: Requires Android Gradle Plugin 8.6.0+ for AndroidX Camera libraries

### Backend Issues

- Plaza ID response may differ from request when ID starts with '0'
- Check backend API responses carefully for ID consistency

### Build Issues

- **Java 24 Compatibility**: Ensure Gradle 8.14+ is used
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: Must be 8.6.0+ for camera dependencies

### Important Notes from Developer

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Developer Warning**: 
> - Don't modify User and Plaza modules unless absolutely necessary (created during late-night coding sessions)
> - Some code might be inefficient but functional - avoid unnecessary refactoring
> - Extensive AI assistance was used to meet deadlines
> - Test thoroughly before deploying changes

## üìù Development Notes

### Architecture

- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **API Communication**: HTTP with error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket & Socket.IO
- **Local Storage**: Secure storage + SharedPreferences
- **Image Processing**: Camera + Image picker + Caching

### Performance Considerations

- Image caching implemented for better performance
- Shimmer loading effects for better UX
- Connectivity checking for offline handling
- Optimized chart rendering with fl_chart

### Security Features

- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Permission handling for camera, location, NFC
- HTTP error handling and validation
